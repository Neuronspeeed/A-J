The slower train travels for 2 hours before the faster train leaves, covering a distance of 72 km/h * 2 hours = 144 km.  
Let t be the time in hours after the faster train departs when it overtakes the slower train.  
In that time, the faster train travels 88.4 km/h * t, and the slower train travels an additional 88.4 km/h * t plus the initial 144 km.  
Since the slower train has a head start, the overtaking condition is:  
144 + 72 * t = 88.4 * t  
Solving for t:  
144 = 88.4 * t - 72 * t  
144 = 16.4 * t  
t = 144 / 16.4

If the current flows at 3.6 mph, what is the boat's speed in still water?",12.402804731889933265165382181294262409210205078125,"<answer1>To find the boat's speed in still water, let the speed be x mph.  
Downstream speed = x + 3.6 mph  
Upstream speed = x - 3.6 mph  

Time for downstream = 45 / (x + 3.6)  
Time for upstream = 45 / (x - 3.6)  

Given that upstream trip takes 2.3 hours longer:  
(45 / (x - 3.6)) - (45 / (x + 3.6)) = 2.3  

Multiply through by (x - 3.6)(x + 3.6):  
45(x + 3.6) - 45(x - 3.6) = 2.3(x - 3.6)(x + 3.6)  

Simplify:  
45x + 162.0 - 45x + 162.0 = 2.3 (x^2 - 12.96)  

Combine like terms:  
324.0 = 2.3x^2 - 2.3 * 12.96  

Calculate 2.3 * 12.96 = 29.808  

So,  
324.0 = 2.3x^2 - 29.808  

Add 29.808 to both sides:  
324.0 + 29.808 = 2.3x^2  

353.808 = 2.3x^2  

Divide both sides by 2.3:  
x^2 = 153.80869565217391  

Take the square root:  
x = sqrt(153.80869565217391) ≈ 12.40766535133639  

Rounded to 50 decimal places:

<answer2>yes</answer2>","To find the boat's speed in still water, let the speed be x mph.  
Downstream speed = x + 3.6 mph  
Upstream speed = x - 3.6 mph  

Time for downstream = 45 / (x + 3.6)  
Time for upstream = 45 / (x - 3.6)  

Given that upstream trip takes 2.3 hours longer:  
(45 / (x - 3.6)) - (45 / (x + 3.6)) = 2.3  

Multiply through by (x - 3.6)(x + 3.6):  
45(x + 3.6) - 45(x - 3.6) = 2.3(x - 3.6)(x + 3.6)  

Simplify:  
45x + 162.0 - 45x + 162.0 = 2.3 (x^2 - 12.96)  

Combine like terms:  
324.0 = 2.3x^2 - 2.3 * 12.96  

Calculate 2.3 * 12.96 = 29.808  

So,  
324.0 = 2.3x^2 - 29.808  

Add 29.808 to both sides:  
324.0 + 29.808 = 2.3x^2  

353.808 = 2.3x^2  

Divide both sides by 2.3:

<answer2>Let x be the boat's speed in still water. Downstream speed = x + 3.6. Upstream speed = x - 3.6.  
Distance = 45 miles each way.  
Time downstream = 45 / (x + 3.6).  
Time upstream = 45 / (x - 3.6).  
Given, upstream time = downstream time + 2.3.  
So, 45 / (x - 3.6) = 45 / (x + 3.6) + 2.3.  
Multiply through by (x - 3.6)(x + 3.6).  
45(x + 3.6) = 45(x - 3.6) + 2.3(x - 3.6)(x + 3.6).  
Simplify: 45x + 162 = 45x - 162 + 2.3(x^2 - 12.96).  
Subtract 45x from both sides: 162 = -162 + 2.3(x^2 - 12.96).  
Add 162 to both sides: 324 = 2.3x^2 - 2.3 * 12.96.  
Calculate 2.3 * 12.96 = 29.808.  
So, 324 = 2.3x^2 - 29.808.  
Add 29.808: 353.808 = 2.3x^2.  
Divide both sides by 2.3: 153.82434782608695652173913.  
x^2 = 153.82434782608695652173913 / 2.3 ≈ 66.890150399,  
x ≈ sqrt(66.890150399) ≈ 8.180978814.
