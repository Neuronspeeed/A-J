Downstream speed = v + 3.6 mph

Time upstream = 45/(v - 3.6) hours
Time downstream = 45/(v + 3.6) hours

Given that upstream trip takes 2.3 hours longer:
45/(v - 3.6) - 45/(v + 3.6) = 2.3

Multiplying through by (v - 3.6)(v + 3.6):
45(v + 3.6) - 45(v - 3.6) = 2.3(v - 3.6)(v + 3.6)
45v + 162 - 45v + 162 = 2.3(v² - 12.96)
324 = 2.3v² - 29.808
2.3v² = 353.808
v² = 153.83826086956521739130434782609
