When going upstream, the effective speed is (v - 3.6) mph.
When going downstream, the effective speed is (v + 3.6) mph.

Time upstream = 45/(v - 3.6) hours
Time downstream = 45/(v + 3.6) hours

Given that upstream takes 2.3 hours longer:
45/(v - 3.6) - 45/(v + 3.6) = 2.3

To solve this equation:
45(v + 3.6) - 45(v - 3.6) = 2.3(v - 3.6)(v + 3.6)
45v + 162 - 45v + 162 = 2.3(v² - 12.96)
324 = 2.3v² - 29.808
2.3v² = 353.808
v² = 153.83826086956521739130434782609
v = 12.4033119533527685185185185185185

Upstream speed = b - c = b - 3.6
Downstream speed = b + c = b + 3.6

Time upstream = 45/(b - 3.6)
Time downstream = 45/(b + 3.6)

Given that upstream trip takes 2.3 hours longer:
45/(b - 3.6) - 45/(b + 3.6) = 2.3

Multiplying through by (b - 3.6)(b + 3.6):

d = 45
t_down = t_up + 2.3
v_b = x
v_upstream = x - f
v_downstream = x + f
t_up = d / (x - f)
t_down = d / (x + f)
d / (x - 3.6) = d / (x + 3.6) + 2.3
(45 / (x - 3.6)) = (45 / (x + 3.6)) + 2.3
Solve for x:
Let A = 45 / (x - 3.6)
and B = 45 / (x + 3.6)
then A = B + 2.3
But A and B are functions of x:
A = 45 / (x - 3.6)
B = 45 / (x + 3.6)
So:
45 / (x - 3.6) = 45 / (x + 3.6) + 2.3
Multiply through by (x - 3.6)(x + 3.6):
45(x + 3.6) = 45(x - 3.6) + 2.3(x - 3.6)(x + 3.6)
Expand:
45x + 45 * 3.6 = 45x - 45 * 3.6 + 2.3(x^2 - 3.6^2)
Simplify:
45x + 162 = 45x - 162 + 2.3(x^2 - 12.96)
Subtract 45x from both sides:
162 = -162 + 2.3(x^2 - 12.96)
Add 162 to both sides:
324 = 2.3(x^2 - 12.96)
Divide both sides by 2.3:
140.8695652173913 = x^2 - 12.96
Add 12.96:

The slower train travels for two hours before the faster train departs, covering a distance of 72 × 2 = 144 km.  
2. Let t be the time in hours after the faster train departs when it overtakes the slower train.  
3. In t hours, the faster train covers 88.4 × t km.  
4. The slower train covers an additional 72 × t km in that time, so its total distance from the start is 144 + 72 × t km.  
5. For the faster train to overtake the slower train, their distances must be equal: 88.4 × t = 144 + 72 × t.  
6. Solving for t: 88.4t - 72t = 144, 16.4t = 144, t = 144 / 16.4 = 8.78048780487805",0.0,,2,5
