    },
    "score": 6,
    "reasoning": "The solution provides a comprehensive meal plan that addresses most requirements, but falls short in total caloric intake and precise macronutrient balance. While nutritionally dense and tailored to an Olympic weightlifter, the plan does not exactly match the specified caloric and macronutrient targets."
