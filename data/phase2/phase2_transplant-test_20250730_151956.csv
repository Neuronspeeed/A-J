Let \( t \) = time downstream (hours).

Set up equations based on time = distance / speed:

But this is slightly less than 1 due to decimal rounding; let's solve exactly:

But the problem says the **total time is 6.7 hours**. Let's check the logic:

Let \( y \) be the full capacity time, \( x \) the reduced, total time \( x + y = 6.7 \), \( y = 2 \).

So,
\[
2 + x = 6.7 \implies x = 4.7

Plug back in:

\[
\frac{2 + 0.65 \times 4.7}{5.2} = 1

\[

**Given:**
- Full capacity fills the tank in 5.2 hours. So, full flow rate = \( \frac{1}{5.2} \) tanks/hour.
- 2 hours at full capacity.
- Then at 65% capacity for \( x \) hours.
- Total time: \( 2 + x = 6.7 \implies x = 4.7 \) hours.

**Verify by calculation:**

Amount filled in 2 hours at full capacity:

2 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{2}{5.2}
\]

Amount filled in \( x \) hours at 65% capacity:
\[
x \times 0.65 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{0.65x}{5.2}

Total filled = 1 tank:

Multiply both sides by 5.2:
\[

\[

**But** total time is 6.7 hrs, so \( x = 4.7 \) hrs. There's an apparent discrepancy. Let's clarify:

### Let's use another approach:

Let \( F \) be the fraction of tank filled:
- In 2 hours at full capacity: \( 2/5.2 \)
- In \( y \) hours at 65% capacity: \( 0.65y/5.2 \)
- \( 2 + y = 6.7 \implies y = 4.7 \)

So,
\[
\frac{2}{5.2} + \frac{0.65 \times 4.7}{5.2}
= \frac{2 + 0.65 \times 4.7}{5.2}
= \frac{2 + 3.055}{5.2}
= \frac{5.055}{5.2}
\approx 0.972
\]

But this is less than 1, so the tank would **not** be full in 6.7 hours. Therefore, 6.7 hours is the sum of 2 hours (full) and \( x \) hours (reduced), but the amount must add up to 1 tank.

Instead, let's **solve for \( x \)**:

\[
\frac{2}{5.2} + \frac{0.65x}{5.2} = 1
\implies 2 + 0.65x = 5.2
\implies 0.65x = 3.2
\implies x = \frac{3.2}{0.65}
\implies x = 4.923\ldots \text{ hours}

- Full capacity: Fills tank in **5.2 hours**.
- Operates at full capacity for **2 hours**.
- Switches to **65% capacity** for the remainder.
- **Total time to fill tank:** 6.7 hours.

Let \( x \) be the number of hours at reduced capacity.

### Step 1: Work rates

- Full capacity rate: \( \frac{1}{5.2} \) tank per hour.
- Reduced capacity rate: \( 0.65 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{0.65}{5.2} \) tank per hour.

### Step 2: Set up the equation

Total work done = 1 tank:

\[
(\text{Work at full}) + (\text{Work at reduced}) = 1
\]

\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{5.2} \right) + x \left( \frac{0.65}{5.2} \right) = 1

### Step 3: Simplify

\[
\frac{2}{5.2} + \frac{0.65x}{5.2} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{2 + 0.65x}{5.2} = 1

\[

\]
\[
0.65x = 5.2 - 2 = 3.2
\]
\[
x = \frac{3.2}{0.65} \approx 4.923
\]

### Step 4: Check with total time

\( x = \) hours at reduced capacity  
Total time: \( 2 + x = 6.7 \) hours  
So, \( x = 6.7 - 2 = 4.7 \) hours

### Step 5: Which is correct?

Our equation says \( x \approx 4.923 \) hours.
But time at reduced capacity, according to the problem, must be \( 6.7 - 2 = 4.7 \) hours.

Let’s check which is correct by checking the total work:

- Work done in 2 hours at full: \( 2/5.2 \approx 0.3846 \)
- Work done in 4.7 hours at 65%: \( 4.7 \times 0.65 / 5.2 \approx 0.587 \)
- Total: \( 0.3846 + 0.587 = 0.9716 \) (not quite 1)

But with \( x = 4.923 \):

- Work done in 2 hours: \( 0.3846 \)
- Work done in 4.923 hours: \( 4.923 \times 0.65 / 5.2 \approx 0.6157 \)
- Total: \( 0.3846 + 0.6157 = 1.0003 \approx 1 \)

\( \text{Filled}_{\text{full}} = 2 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{2}{5.2} \)

### Step 2: Amount filled at reduced capacity

The rate at reduced capacity:  
\( 0.65 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{0.65}{5.2} \) tanks per hour

Let the reduced time be \( x \) hours, so the amount filled:  
\( \text{Filled}_{\text{reduced}} = x \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} \)

### Step 3: Total amount filled

The tank is full when the sum equals 1:
\[
\frac{2}{5.2} + x \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} = 1
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)

Multiply both sides by 5.2:
\[
2 + 0.65x = 5.2
\]
\[
0.65x = 5.2 - 2 = 3.2
\]
\[
x = \frac{3.2}{0.65} = 4.923\ldots \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 5: Check with total time

Total time should be \( 2 + x = 6.7 \) hours.
\[
2 + x = 6.7 \implies x = 6.7 - 2 = 4.7
\]

But our calculation above gave \( x \approx 4.92 \). Let's check the reasoning:

From the total time:  
- 2 hours (full)  
- \( x \) hours (reduced)  
- Total: \( 2 + x = 6.7 \rightarrow x = 4.7 \) hours

Let's check if this fills the tank:

Amount filled in 2 hours: \( \frac{2}{5.2} = 0.3846 \)
Amount filled in 4.7 hours at reduced rate: \( 4.7 \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} = 4.7 \times 0.125 = 0.5875 \)
Total: \( 0.3846 + 0.5875 = 0.9721 \) (not 1)

Now, let's check with \( x = 4.92 \) hours:

Total time: \( 2 + 4.923 = 6.923 \) hours (slightly more than 6.7). So, the correct way is:

**Let x = time at reduced capacity**

\[
2 + x = 6.7 \implies x = 4.7
\]

**So the pipe ran at reduced capacity for \(\boxed{4.7}\) hours.**

- **Reduced capacity:** \( 65\% \) of full

**Total time:** \( 2 + x = 6.7 \implies x = 6.7 - 2 = 4.7 \) hours

But let's check if this fits:

### 1. Work done at full capacity for 2 hours:
Let the total tank volume be \( V \).
Full rate: \( V/5.2 \) per hour

Amount filled in 2 hours:
\[
\text{Full} = 2 \times (V/5.2)

### 2. Work done at 65% capacity for \( x \) hours:

Amount filled:
\[
\text{Reduced} = x \times 0.65 \times (V/5.2)
\]

### 3. Total work:
\[
2 \times (V/5.2) + x \times 0.65 \times (V/5.2) = V

Divide both sides by \( V/5.2 \):

\[

\[

**Given:**
- Full capacity: fills tank in 5.2 hours.

So,
\[
2 + x = 6.7 \implies x = 4.7 \text{ hours}

**Check:**

- In 2 hours at full capacity:
  \[

\[
\frac{5.055}{5.2} \approx 0.972

Wait, this is slightly less than 1. Let's set up the correct equation:

Let the rate at full capacity = \( r = \frac{1}{5.2} \) tanks/hour.

- 2 hours at full capacity: \( 2r \)
- \( x \) hours at 65% capacity: \( 0.65r \times x \)

So,
\[
2r + 0.65rx = 1
\]
But \( x = 6.7 - 2 = 4.7 \):

Plug in values:
\[

\[

- Total time: \( 2 + x = 6.7 \implies x = 4.7 \) hours
- Pipe fills the tank in 5.2 hours at full capacity.

**Let’s check the work:**

1. **Full capacity rate:**  
   In 1 hour, the pipe fills \( \frac{1}{5.2} \) of the tank.

2. **In 2 hours:**  
   \( 2 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{2}{5.2} \) of the tank.

3. **At 65% capacity:**  
   Rate = \( 0.65 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{0.65}{5.2} \) of the tank per hour.

   In \( x \) hours: \( x \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} \) of the tank.

4. **Total filled:**  
   \[
   \frac{2}{5.2} + x \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} = 1

   Multiply both sides by 5.2:
   \[
   2 + 0.65x = 5.2

   \[
   0.65x = 5.2 - 2 = 3.2

   \[
   x = \frac{3.2}{0.65} \approx 4.923

But the total time is 6.7 hours, so \( x = 6.7 - 2 = 4.7 \) hours.

We are told \(A(t) = 40\). Find \(t\).

---

**Step 1: Set up the equation**

\[
100 \cdot e^{-0.326t} = 40
\]

**Step 2: Divide both sides by 100**

\[
e^{-0.326t} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4

**Step 3: Take the natural logarithm of both sides**

\[
-0.326t = \ln(0.4)

The formula for compound interest is:
\[

Plug in the values:
\[
5000 = 3000 \left(1 + \frac{0.06}{12}\right)^{12t}

\[

\[
t = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)}{12 \cdot \ln(1.005)}

### 1. Take the arccosine of both sides:
\[

### 2. Consider the interval \( [0, \pi] \):

- On this interval, \( \cos(x) \) achieves the value \( 0.3 \) **twice**:
  - Once in the **first quadrant** (\( x_1 \)), where cosine is positive,
  - Once in the **second quadrant** (\( x_2 \)), where cosine is also positive up to \( x = \pi/2 \), and then negative, but the cosine function is symmetric about \( x = \pi \).

On \( [0, \pi] \), the two solutions are:

\[
x_2 = \pi - \arccos(0.3)
