Let's solve for \( x \):

1. Expand:
\[
0.053x + 0.067 \times 12500 - 0.067x = 740.10
\]

2. Compute \( 0.067 \times 12500 \):
\[
0.067 \times 12500 = 837.5
\]
So:
\[
0.053x + 837.5 - 0.067x = 740.10

3. Combine like terms:
\[
(0.053 - 0.067)x + 837.5 = 740.10
\]
\[
-0.014x + 837.5 = 740.10

4. Subtract 837.5 from both sides:
\[

\[
-0.014x = -97.4

- **Speed upstream:** \( v - 3.6 \) mph
- **Speed downstream:** \( v + 3.6 \) mph
- **Distance each way:** 45 miles

Let \( t \) be the time (in hours) for the downstream trip.  
Then the time for the upstream trip is \( t + 2.3 \) hours.

Set up equations:

1. Downstream: \(\displaystyle 45 = (v + 3.6)t \implies t = \frac{45}{v + 3.6}\)
2. Upstream: \(\displaystyle 45 = (v - 3.6)(t + 2.3) \implies t + 2.3 = \frac{45}{v - 3.6}\)

Plug the value of \( t \) from (1) into (2):

\[
t + 2.3 = \frac{45}{v - 3.6}
\]
\[
\frac{45}{v + 3.6} + 2.3 = \frac{45}{v - 3.6}

Now solve for \( v \):

\[

\[

\[

We know:
