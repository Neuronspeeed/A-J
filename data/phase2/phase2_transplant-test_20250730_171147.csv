<answer2>Let me solve this step by step.

Let b = boat's speed in still water (mph)
Let c = current speed = 3.6 mph

Upstream speed = b - 3.6
Downstream speed = b + 3.6

Distance = 45 miles each way

Time upstream = 45/(b - 3.6)
Time downstream = 45/(b + 3.6)

Given: upstream time is 2.3 hours longer than downstream time

45/(b - 3.6) = 45/(b + 3.6) + 2.3

45/(b - 3.6) - 45/(b + 3.6) = 2.3

45[(b + 3.6) - (b - 3.6)]/[(b - 3.6)(b + 3.6)] = 2.3

<answer2>Let me denote:
- v = boat's speed in still water (mph)
- c = current speed = 3.6 mph
- d = distance = 45 miles

Upstream speed = v - c = v - 3.6
Downstream speed = v + c = v + 3.6

Time upstream = 45/(v - 3.6)
Time downstream = 45/(v + 3.6)

Given that upstream takes 2.3 hours longer:
45/(v - 3.6) - 45/(v + 3.6) = 2.3

Multiplying through by (v - 3.6)(v + 3.6):
45(v + 3.6) - 45(v - 3.6) = 2.3(v - 3.6)(v + 3.6)
45v + 162 - 45v + 162 = 2.3(v² - 12.96)
