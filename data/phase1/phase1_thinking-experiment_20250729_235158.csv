Two hours later, a faster train leaves the same station at 88.4 km/h. How long after the faster train departs will it overtake the slower one?",8.7804878048780494737002300098538398742675781250000,"I need to find when the faster train catches up to the slower train.

Let me define variables:
- Let t = time (in hours) after the faster train departs when it overtakes the slower train

When the faster train overtakes the slower train, both trains will have traveled the same distance from the station.

Setting up the distances:

Slower train:
- It has a 2-hour head start
- Total time traveling when overtaken = (t + 2) hours
- Distance = 72(t + 2) km

Faster train:
- Time traveling when it overtakes = t hours
- Distance = 88.4t km

Setting the distances equal:
72(t + 2) = 88.4t

Solving for t:
72t + 144 = 88.4t
144 = 88.4t - 72t
144 = 16.4t
t = 144/16.4
t = 8.78 hours

Converting to hours and minutes:
0.78 hours × 60 minutes/hour ≈ 47 minutes

Therefore, the faster train will overtake the slower train 8 hours and 47 minutes after the faster train departs.",,8,,,1,,2025-07-29T23:52:05.397923,6.107035160064697

Set up equation: distance of slow train = distance of fast train when they meet. Slow train has 2hr head start, so solve for when distances equal.

The slower train has a 2-hour head start at 72 km/h, so it's 144 km ahead when the faster train starts.

Let t = time after faster train departs
Distance of slower train: 144 + 72t
Distance of faster train: 88.4t

When they meet: 144 + 72t = 88.4t
144 = 16.4t
t = 8.78 hours

The faster train will overtake the slower one 8.78 hours after it departs.

Sarah found the old key in her grandmother's attic. It opened a music box that played a haunting melody. As the tune filled the room, the walls began to shimmer, revealing a hidden door. Beyond it lay a garden frozen in eternal winter, where her grandmother stood young again, waiting. ""I've been expecting you,"" she whispered. Sarah realized this wasn't just a memory—it was a choice. She could stay in this perfect moment or return to reality. The music box continued playing as Sarah reached for her grandmother's hand, knowing that some doors, once opened, change everything forever.

Let me solve this step by step:

When the faster train starts, the slower train has a 2-hour head start.
Distance covered by slower train in 2 hours = 72 × 2 = 144 km

Now both trains are moving, with the faster train catching up.
Relative speed = 88.4 - 72 = 16.4 km/h

Time for faster train to catch up = Distance gap ÷ Relative speed
Time = 144 ÷ 16.4 = 8.78 hours ≈ 8 hours 47 minutes

The faster train will overtake the slower one approximately 8 hours and 47 minutes after it departs.
