How long after the faster train departs will it overtake the slower one?",8.7804878048780494737002300098538398742675781250000,"<answer1>
Let me solve this step by step.

When the faster train starts, the slower train has already traveled for 2 hours at 72 km/h.
Distance covered by slower train = 72 × 2 = 144 km

Let t = time (in hours) after the faster train departs when it overtakes the slower train.

At the moment of overtaking:
- Distance traveled by faster train = 88.4t km
- Distance traveled by slower train = 144 + 72t km (initial 144 km plus additional distance)

Setting them equal:
88.4t = 144 + 72t
88.4t - 72t = 144
16.4t = 144
t = 144/16.4
t = 8.78048780487804878048780487804878048780487804878049

Set up equations for distances traveled. When they meet, distances are equal. Slower train has 2-hour head start, so it travels 144 km extra initially.

Maya discovered her grandmother's locked diary in the dusty attic. Inside, cryptic entries revealed a family secret: her grandfather wasn't dead but hiding in witness protection after exposing corporate corruption. The final entry contained coordinates. Following them led Maya to a remote cabin where she found him, aged but alive. He explained how powerful enemies forced him to fake his death to protect the family. Now terminally ill, he'd been waiting for someone to find him. Maya faced an impossible choice: reveal the truth and endanger everyone, or let her family continue grieving a lie. As sirens wailed in the distance, she realized someone had followed her, and her grandfather's past had finally caught up with them both.

Maya discovered the antique music box in her grandmother's attic, its melody hauntingly familiar. When she wound it, memories flooded back—her mother humming the same tune before disappearing when Maya was five. Inside, a hidden compartment revealed a letter: ""My dearest Maya, I had to leave to protect you from those hunting our family's secret. The melody is a map. Follow it home."" That night, Maya played the tune on her violin. Street lamps flickered in sequence, forming a path through the city. At the old lighthouse, she found her mother waiting, tears streaming. ""You found me,"" her mother whispered. ""Now I can teach you about our gift—we're guardians of music's magic, and it's time you learned your true purpose.""
