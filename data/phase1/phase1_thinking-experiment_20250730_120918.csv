Let me define the variables:
- Let t = time (in hours) after the faster train departs when it overtakes the slower train

Setting up the problem:
- Slower train: travels at 72 km/h and has a 2-hour head start
- Faster train: travels at 88.4 km/h starting 2 hours later

When the faster train overtakes the slower train, both trains will have traveled the same distance from the station.

Distance traveled by slower train = Distance traveled by faster train

The slower train travels for (t + 2) hours total at 72 km/h:
Distance = 72(t + 2)

The faster train travels for t hours at 88.4 km/h:
Distance = 88.4t

Setting them equal:
72(t + 2) = 88.4t
72t + 144 = 88.4t
144 = 88.4t - 72t
144 = 16.4t
t = 144/16.4
t = 8.78 hours

Converting to hours and minutes:
0.78 hours = 0.78 × 60 = 46.8 minutes ≈ 47 minutes

Therefore, the faster train will overtake the slower train 8 hours and 47 minutes after the faster train departs.",,144,,,0,,2025-07-30T12:09:23.855674,5.149667739868164

When the faster train starts, the slower train has a 144 km head start (72 km/h × 2 hours). The faster train gains 16.4 km/h (88.4 - 72). Time to catch up: 144 ÷ 16.4 = 8.78 hours ≈ 8 hours 47 minutes.

Sarah found the old key in her grandmother's attic. It opened a music box that played a haunting melody. As the tune filled the air, the room transformed—dusty furniture became elegant antiques, and a young woman appeared in the mirror. ""Thank you,"" the reflection whispered. ""I've been trapped since 1943, waiting for someone to play our song."" The woman was Sarah's great-aunt, lost during the war. As the melody ended, she faded with a smile. Sarah kept the music box, knowing she'd freed a soul and discovered family history. The key now hung around her neck—a bridge between past and present, love transcending time itself.

When the faster train departs, the slower train has a 2-hour head start at 72 km/h, so it's 144 km ahead.

The relative speed difference is 88.4 - 72 = 16.4 km/h.

To catch up 144 km at a relative speed of 16.4 km/h:
Time = 144 ÷ 16.4 = 8.78 hours

The faster train will overtake the slower one approximately 8.78 hours (or 8 hours and 47 minutes) after it departs.

Let me define variables:
- Let x = amount invested at 6.7%
- Then (12,500 - x) = amount invested at 5.3%

Setting up the equation based on total interest earned:
Interest from 6.7% investment + Interest from 5.3% investment = Total interest

0.067x + 0.053(12,500 - x) = 740.10

Expanding the equation:
0.067x + 0.053(12,500) - 0.053x = 740.10
0.067x + 662.50 - 0.053x = 740.10

Combining like terms:
(0.067 - 0.053)x + 662.50 = 740.10
0.014x + 662.50 = 740.10

Solving for x:
0.014x = 740.10 - 662.50
0.014x = 77.60
x = 77.60 ÷ 0.014
x = 5,542.86

Let me verify this answer:
- Amount at 6.7%: $5,542.86
- Amount at 5.3%: $12,500 - $5,542.86 = $6,957.14
- Interest from 6.7%: $5,542.86 × 0.067 = $371.37
- Interest from 5.3%: $6,957.14 × 0.053 = $368.73
- Total interest: $371.37 + $368.73 = $740.10 ✓
