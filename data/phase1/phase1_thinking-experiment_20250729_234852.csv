Two hours later, a faster train leaves the same station at 88.4 km/h. How long after the faster train departs will it overtake the slower one?",8.7804878048780494737002300098538398742675781250000,"I need to find when the faster train catches up to the slower train.

Let me define variables:
- Let t = time (in hours) after the faster train departs when it overtakes the slower train

When the faster train overtakes the slower train, they will have traveled the same distance from the station.

Distance traveled by slower train:
- It has a 2-hour head start, so it travels for (t + 2) hours total
- Distance = 72(t + 2) km

Distance traveled by faster train:
- It travels for t hours
- Distance = 88.4t km

Setting the distances equal:
72(t + 2) = 88.4t

Expanding:
72t + 144 = 88.4t

Solving for t:
144 = 88.4t - 72t
144 = 16.4t
t = 144/16.4
t = 8.78 hours

Let me verify:
- Slower train travels for (8.78 + 2) = 10.78 hours at 72 km/h = 776.16 km
- Faster train travels for 8.78 hours at 88.4 km/h = 776.15 km ✓

Therefore, the faster train will overtake the slower train 8.78 hours (or 8 hours and 47 minutes) after the faster train departs.",,8.78,,,3,,2025-07-29T23:48:58.292214,4.992071151733398

Let me define variables:
- Let t = time (in hours) after the faster train departs when it overtakes the slower train

When the faster train overtakes the slower train, both trains will have traveled the same distance from the station.

Setting up the distances:

**Slower train:**
- Speed: 72 km/h
- It has a 2-hour head start
- Total time traveling when overtaken: (t + 2) hours
- Distance: 72(t + 2) km

**Faster train:**
- Speed: 88.4 km/h
- Time traveling when it overtakes: t hours
- Distance: 88.4t km

Setting the distances equal:
72(t + 2) = 88.4t

Solving for t:
72t + 144 = 88.4t
144 = 88.4t - 72t
144 = 16.4t
t = 144/16.4
t = 8.78 hours

Converting to hours and minutes:
0.78 hours × 60 minutes/hour ≈ 47 minutes

Therefore, the faster train will overtake the slower train **8 hours and 47 minutes** after the faster train departs.",,8,,,1,,2025-07-29T23:49:03.937122,5.643838405609131

The slower train has a 2-hour head start at 72 km/h, so it's 144 km ahead when the faster train starts.

Let t = time after faster train departs
Distance equation: 72(t + 2) = 88.4t
144 + 72t = 88.4t
144 = 16.4t
t = 8.78 hours

The faster train will overtake the slower one 8.78 hours after it departs.
