**Step 1: Distance covered by each train at the point of overtaking**

- **Slower train:**  
  It has a 2-hour head start at 72 km/h, so in 2 hours:  
  \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \) km head start.

  After the faster train leaves, the slower train continues at 72 km/h for \( t \) more hours:
  Total distance = \( 144 + 72t \)

- **Faster train:**  
  It covers \( 88.4t \) km in \( t \) hours.

**At the point of overtaking, distances are equal:**
\[
88.4t = 144 + 72t

**Step 2: Solve for \( t \):**
\[
88.4t - 72t = 144 \\

**Distance traveled by slower train:**  
By the time the faster train leaves, the slower train has already traveled:
\[
\text{Lead distance} = 72 \text{ km/h} \times 2 \text{ h} = 144 \text{ km}
\]

From then on, let \( t \) be the additional time (in hours) both are traveling, with the slower train at 72 km/h and the faster at 88.4 km/h.

- Distance traveled by slower train in \( t \) hours: \( 72t \)
- Distance traveled by faster train in \( t \) hours: \( 88.4t \)

**Step 1: Distance traveled by each train**

Let the slower train's total travel time be \( t + 2 \) hours (since it left 2 hours earlier).

- Distance traveled by slower train: \( 72 \times (t + 2) \)
- Distance traveled by faster train: \( 88.4 \times t \)

At overtaking, these distances are equal:

\[
72(t + 2) = 88.4t
\]

**Step 2: Solve for \( t \)**

\[
72t + 144 = 88.4t
\]
\[
144 = 88.4t - 72t

\[
144 = 16.4t

   0.014x = 740.10 - 662.5 = 77.6

3. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{77.6}{0.014} = 5,542.857...

\[
\boxed{5,542.86}

- **Full capacity rate:** \( \frac{1}{5.2} \) of the tank per hour.
- **Reduced (65%) capacity rate:** \( 0.65 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{0.65}{5.2} \) of the tank per hour.
- **Time at full capacity:** 2 hours.
- **Time at reduced capacity:** \( x \) hours.
- **Total time:** \( 2 + x = 6.7 \implies x = 4.7 \) hours.

Let's check:

1. **Amount filled at full capacity:**
   \[
   2 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{2}{5.2}
   \]
2. **Amount filled at reduced capacity:**
   \[

   \]

Sum must be 1 (full tank):

\[
\frac{2}{5.2} + 4.7 \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} = 1
\]

Let's solve:

\[
\frac{2}{5.2} + \frac{4.7 \times 0.65}{5.2} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{2 + 4.7 \times 0.65}{5.2} = 1
\]
\[
2 + 4.7 \times 0.65 = 5.2
\]
\[
4.7 \times 0.65 = 5.2 - 2 = 3.2

\[
4.7 \times 0.65 = 3.055
\]

But \( 3.055 \neq 3.2 \). Let's solve for \( x \) explicitly:

\[
\frac{2}{5.2} + \frac{x \times 0.65}{5.2} = 1
\]
\[
2 + 0.65x = 5.2

\[
0.65x = 3.2

\[

If the tank is full in 6.7 hours total, how long did it run at reduced capacity?",4.9230769230769233502087445231154561042785644531250,"Let \( x \) = hours the pipe runs at **reduced capacity**.

### Step 1: Amount filled at full capacity

- Full capacity rate = \( \frac{1}{5.2} \) tanks/hour
- Time at full capacity = 2 hours
- Amount filled = \( 2 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{2}{5.2} \)

### Step 2: Amount filled at reduced capacity

- Reduced rate = \( 0.65 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{0.65}{5.2} \) tanks/hour
- Time at reduced capacity = \( x \) hours
- Amount filled = \( x \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} \)

### Step 3: Total time

Total time = \( 2 + x = 6.7 \implies x = 6.7 - 2 = 4.7 \) hours

### Step 4: Check that the tank is full

Total filled = 1 tank:

\[
\frac{2}{5.2} + 4.7 \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} = 1
\]

Let's check:

\[
\frac{2}{5.2} + \frac{4.7 \times 0.65}{5.2} = \frac{2 + 4.7 \times 0.65}{5.2}
\]

Calculate \( 4.7 \times 0.65 = 3.055 \):

\[
\frac{2 + 3.055}{5.2} = \frac{5.055}{5.2} = 0.9721
\]

Slightly less than 1. Let's solve for \( x \) exactly:

### Step 5: Set up the exact equation

\[
\frac{2}{5.2} + x \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} = 1
\]

Multiply both sides by 5.2:

\[
2 + 0.65x = 5.2
\]
\[
0.65x = 5.2 - 2 = 3.2
\]
\[
x = \frac{3.2}{0.65} = 4.923\ldots

- **At full capacity:** 2 hours.
- **At 65% capacity:** \( x \) hours.
- **Total time:** \( 2 + x = 6.7 \implies x = 4.7 \) hours.

Let’s check with rates:

- Pipe fills tank in 5.2 hours \(\rightarrow\) rate \( = \frac{1}{5.2} \) tanks/hour.
- At 65% capacity: \( 0.65 \times \frac{1}{5.2} = \frac{0.65}{5.2} \) tanks/hour.

**Equation:**

\[
\text{Total filled} = 2 \times \frac{1}{5.2} + x \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} = 1
\]

Plug in \( x = 4.7 \):

\[
2 \times \frac{1}{5.2} + 4.7 \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} = \frac{2}{5.2} + \frac{3.055}{5.2} = \frac{5.055}{5.2} \approx 0.972
\]

Not quite 1, so let's set up to solve for \( x \):

\[
2 \times \frac{1}{5.2} + x \times \frac{0.65}{5.2} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{2}{5.2} + \frac{0.65 x}{5.2} = 1
\]
\[
2 + 0.65x = 5.2

\[
0.65x = 3.2

\[
x = \frac{3.2}{0.65} = 4.923\ \text{hours}

Set up the equation:

Divide both sides by 1500:
\[

\[

Calculate numerically:
\[
