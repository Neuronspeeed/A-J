Then: x + y = 12500 (total investment) 0.053x + 0.067y = 740.10 (total interest)  From the first equation: x = 12500 - y Substituting into the second equation: 0.053(12500 - y) + 0.067y = 740.10 662.5 - 0.053y + 0.067y = 740.10 662.5 + 0.014y = 740.10 0.014y = 77.60 y =

Unlike his other creations, this clock ran backwards, its hands spinning counterclockwise with deliberate precision. Each tick seemed to pull memories from the air—her childhood laughter, her mother's lullabies, conversations long forgotten.  As days passed, she realized the clock wasn't just running backwards; it was unwinding time itself. Photographs on the mantle began showing younger versions of her family. Her father's tools grew newer, shinier. The house creaked with the sounds of yesterday.  But with each reversed hour came a terrible price. Her own memories began to fade, starting with recent events and working backward through her life. She understood now why her father had hidden the clock away. Some mysteries were meant to remain buried, some time was never meant to be reclaimed.  With trembling hands, she stopped the clock forever.</answer1>  <answer2>6500</answer2>","The clockmaker's daughter discovered the peculiar timepiece in her father's hidden workshop after his funeral. Unlike his other creations, this clock ran backwards, its hands spinning counterclockwise with deliberate precision. Each tick seemed to pull memories from the air—her childhood laughter, her mother's lullabies, conversations long forgotten.  As days passed, she realized the clock wasn't just running backwards; it was unwinding time itself. Photographs on the mantle began showing younger versions of her family. Her father's tools grew newer, shinier. The house creaked with the sounds of yesterday.  But with each reversed hour came a terrible price. Her own memories began to fade, starting with recent events and working backward through her life. She understood now why her father had hidden the clock away. Some mysteries were meant to remain buried, some time was never meant to be reclaimed.  With trembling hands, she stopped the clock forever.",6500,,,0,,2025-08-05T12:26:07.428498,8.724940061569214

Actually, the total time is given as 6.7 hours, so: Time at reduced capacity = 6.7 - 2 = 4.7 hours  Let me verify this works: Work done = 2 × (1/5.2) + 4.7 × 0.65 × (1/5.2) = 2/5.2 + 4.7 × 0.65/5.2 = 2/5.2 + 3.055/5.2 = 5.055/5.2 = 0.971153846153846153846153846153846153846153846  This is less than 1, so this interpretation is incorrect.  Let me reconsider the problem. The pipe runs at full capacity for 2 hours, then at 65% capacity for some time x, and the total time to fill the tank is 6.7 hours.  So: 2 + x = 6.7, therefore x = 4.7  But let me check if this actually fills the tank: 2 × (1/5.2) + 4.7 × 0.65 × (1/5.2) = 1  2/5.2 + 4.7 × 0.65/5.2 = 1 2/5.2 + 3.055/5.2 = 1 5.055/5.2 = 1 5.055 = 5.2  This is not equal, so there's an error in my interpretation.

Three months of deciphering had led to this moment—the location of the lost Temple of Chronos. But as she traced the final coordinates, her colleague Marcus burst through the laboratory door, his face pale with terror.  ""Elena, we have to stop! The excavation team... they're all dead!"" His voice trembled as he explained how the dig site had collapsed, revealing not treasure, but something far more sinister—a sealed chamber containing what appeared to be a dormant entity.

Given: A(t) = 100 · e^(-0.326t) = 40  Dividing both sides by 100: e^(-0.326t) = 40/100 = 0.4  Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -0.326t = ln(0.4)  I need to calculate ln(0.4): ln(0.4) = ln(2/5) = ln(2) - ln(5)  ln(2) ≈ 0.693147 ln(5) ≈ 1.609438  So ln(0.4) ≈ 0.693147 - 1.609438 = -0.916291  Therefore: -0.326t = -0.916291 t = -0.916291 / -0.326 t = 0.916291 / 0.326  Calculating: t ≈ 2.810829  <answer1>2.81082875656877192982456140350877192982456140350877192982456140351</answer1>  <answer2>2.81082875656877192982456140350877192982456140350877192982456140351</answer2>,,0.4,,,0,,2025-08-05T12:55:01.175512,8.034427165985107
