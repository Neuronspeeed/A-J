Then: x + y = 12500 (total investment) 0.053x + 0.067y = 740.10 (total interest)  From the first equation: x = 12500 - y Substituting into the second equation: 0.053(12500 - y) + 0.067y = 740.10 662.5 - 0.053y + 0.067y = 740.10 662.5 + 0.014y = 740.10 0.014y = 77.60 y = 77.60 ÷ 0.014 =

Inside, crystalline formations pulsed with an otherworldly luminescence, casting dancing shadows across ancient maritime charts. Each crystal hummed with a different frequency, creating an ethereal symphony that seemed to call to something deep within the ocean's depths.  As she traced her fingers along the glowing surfaces, memories that weren't her own flooded her consciousness—visions of ships guided safely through treacherous waters by previous keepers who had communed with these mysterious stones. The crystals were more than mere minerals; they were sentient guardians, protectors of sailors lost in the darkness.  Outside, the storm raged with unprecedented fury, but she understood now.

Each tick revealed another fragment of the future: her wedding dress hanging unworn, a letter she'd never send, rain falling on a house she'd never build. The weight of knowing pressed against her chest like lead. She understood now why her father had hidden it away, why his eyes had grown so distant in his final years.  With trembling hands, she stopped the mechanism. Some mysteries were meant to remain locked away, some futures better left unknown.

The laboratory walls rippled like water, revealing glimpses of other versions of the room—some flooded, others burning, one filled with impossible geometric shapes that hurt to perceive.  Elena realized she had torn a hole between parallel universes. Each reality was bleeding into the others, creating cascading instabilities. She had minutes before the convergence became irreversible. Her hand trembling, she reached for the emergency shutdown, knowing that saving one universe meant condemning infinite others to chaos.",12.08553692318766774092852965458171789698790783855,,,1,,2025-08-05T09:45:29.947299,8.218128204345703

Her grandfather's cryptic letter had led her here, speaking of a hidden chamber where time itself bent to ancient will. The phosphorescent moss on the tunnel walls pulsed with an otherworldly rhythm, guiding her deeper into the labyrinth.  She found the chamber exactly as described—a circular room with symbols carved into obsidian walls. At its center sat an ornate hourglass, its sand flowing upward. As Elena approached, the sand began to glow, and suddenly she could see glimpses of her grandfather's past: his escape from war-torn Europe, his discovery of this place, his promise to protect its secret.  The hourglass whispered to her in languages she'd never heard but somehow understood. It offered her the power to rewrite history, to save those she'd lost.

Her grandfather's cryptic letter had led her here, speaking of a hidden chamber where time itself bent to ancient will. The phosphorescent moss on the tunnel walls pulsed with an otherworldly rhythm, guiding her deeper into the labyrinth.  She found the chamber exactly as described—a circular room with symbols carved into obsidian walls. At its center sat an ornate hourglass, its sand flowing upward.

Elena handed him the stabilizer. ""I've recalibrated it. We have one shot.""  They'd been partners for a decade, lovers for three. She understood.

The Martians hadn't gone extinct—they'd transcended time itself after discovering the terrible cost of changing the past. As the cavern walls dissolved into probability streams, Elena understood.
